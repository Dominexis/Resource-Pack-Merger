# Resource Pack Merger
The Resource Pack Merger is used to merge several resource packs into one for use with the Dom's Nexus module collection. It is not itself a module but is useful to use alongside them.

# Dom's Nexus
This Python script is a tool for Dom's Nexus. Find the Nexus and links to the official modules here: https://github.com/Dominexis/Doms-Nexus

# Terms of Use
These are the terms of use for using Dom's Nexus and the official modules for development. Any restrictions posed by these terms supersede freedoms granted by the attached license.
1) Anything you do with any of these packs including modification or distribution, credit me and link back to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/Dominexis
2) You are allowed to modify the Nexus if it is used in a map or on a server in any way you wish, but you are not allowed to publicly redistribute the modified version of the Nexus outside of a map. You are allowed to include the Nexus in a map and distribute the map whether the Nexus is modified or unmodified. But do not distribute the Nexus outside of a map. Instead, link to this repository.
3) The terms applied to the Nexus also apply to the External Time Measurer, the Database Library, and the Function Tree Library.
4) Do not distribute Nexus modules outside of a map that rely on a modified version of the Nexus. Any module which is publicly distributed expects the Nexus to contain certain features and releasing a module which relies on a modified version of the Nexus would create compatibility issues. Every module which you release as a standalone module outside of a map must depend on an official unmodified version of the Nexus.
5) You may modify and redistribute the Template Module in any way you wish.

# Beta Release
Currently Dom's Nexus is under an open beta, meaning that the feature list is incomplete, but I am releasing it to the world to stress test it before the official release. I am looking for people to point out flaws or bugs as well as suggestions for how to make it better and more intuitive.
